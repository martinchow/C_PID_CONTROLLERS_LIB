# C-library with floating point P, PI, PD, PID-controllers implementation

This embedded C-library provides the various types of P/I/D-controllers:
  * Proportional (P) controller
  *	Proportional–integral (PI) controller
  * Proportional–derivative (PD) controller
  *	Proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller
